        <img src="images/korean_empire_flag.png" alt="korean empire picture" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;">
        <p>In 1987, Joseon was renamed the Korean Empire, and King Gojong became Emperor Gojong. The imperial government
            aimed to become a strong and independent nation by implementing domestic reforms, strengthening militay, developing
            commerce and industry, and surveying land ownership. Russian influence was strong in the empire until Japan defeated
            them in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. The Korean Empire offically became a protectorate of Japan on 
            November 17, 1905.

        <img src="images/korea_japanese_rule.jpeg" alt="japanese rule" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;">
        <p>In 1910, the Empire of Japan effectively annexed Korea through the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty. After the annexation,
            Japan set out to supress many traditional Korean customs, including eventually the Korean language itself. Economic policies
            were implemented primarily for Japanese benefit. The school curriculum was radically modified to eliminate teaching of the 
            Korean language and history. The language was banned and Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names. Numerous Korean cultural
            artifacts were either destroyed or taken to Japan. Koreans formed the Liberation Army in Manchuria and would travel in and out of
            the Sino-Korean border to fight Japanese forces. In 1945, the Japanese were defeated by the Liberation Army and the National
            Revolutionary Army.

        <h4>Division and Korean War (1945 - 1953)</h4>
        <img src="images/korean_war.jpeg" alt="korean war" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;">
        <p>At the Cairo Conference on November 22, 1943, the US, UK, and China agreed that "in due course Korea shall become free and
            independent", and at a later meeting in Yalta in February 1945, the Allies agreed to establish a four-power trusteeship over
            Korea. The unconditional surrender of Japan, combined with fundamental shifts in global politics and ideology, led to the division 
            of Korea into two occupation zones, effectively starting on September 8, 1945. The US administered the southern half and the 
            Soviet Union took the northern half. The division was meant to be temporary but on June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out when 
            North Korea breached the 38th parallel line to invade the South, ending any hope for a peaceful reunification. After the war, the 
            1954 Geneva Conference failed to adopt a solution for a unified Korea. The Korean War was perhaps the deadliest conflict of the 
            Cold-War era.

        <h4>Modern Korea (1953 - Present)</h4>
        <img src="images/modern_korea.jpeg" alt="korean war" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;">
        <p>Beginning with SyngMan Rhee in 1948, a series of autocratic governments took power in South Korea with American support and influence.
            In order to promote economic development, a policy of export-oriented industrialization was applied. South Korea's economic development 
            was spearheaded by the chaebol, family conglomerates such as Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and LG. Despite occasional political instability, 
            the Korean economy saw enormous growth for nearly forty years, in a period known as the Miracle on the Han River. The unparalleled econmoic 
            miracle brought South Korea from one of the poorest countries after the Korean War into a fully developed country within a generation. Today,
            South Korea is a leading economy and a technological powerhouse, rivaling even countries such as the United States in information and communications
            technology. South Korean pop culture has also boomed in recent years, in a phenomenon known as the Korean Wave. On April 27, 2018, both North and 
            South Korea signed the Panmunjom Declaration on ending the conflict between the two countries and reunifying Korea in the future.
